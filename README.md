# yelp-data-classification

The primary objective of this project is to help identify important attributes for restaurants

and to analyze how these attributes impact user reviews. We hope that the results of this

project will allow poorly reviewed businesses to re-evaluate their business model and

incorporate the attributes identified as important into their business so as to achieve an

increased popularity and better performance.
